pamela - a PAM wrapper for secure execution
-------------------------------------------

 pamela is a library implementing the PAM API.

 Traditional PAM implementations such as Linux-PAM
load PAM modules dynamically into the application's address
space. This is unsafe and exposes a lot of attack surface.
Instead, pamela encapsulates the inner workings of PAM
in a binary which is itself linked against Linux-PAM and
performs all the module loading in its own address space;
pamela provides an implementation of the PAM user API that
communicates with that binary, keeping the application's
address space free of external modules.
